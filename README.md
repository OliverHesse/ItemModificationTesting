testing adding some sort of item modification system for a bigger plugin





TODO
- 
- clean up storage and processing of chips
- get page changing working
- change system to work with both passive and active chips
- change system to read chip data from a config file and just store IDs(makes life piss easy for me)
- by simplifying it to only swapping item ids it makes the system a lot more lightweight
- some stuff i have not thought of yet
